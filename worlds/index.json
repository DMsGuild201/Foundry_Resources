				"There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.",
				"The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named Odwald Ebonhart has stirred the elemental aspect of fire, which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect's energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes.",

				"Krenko's Way is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level adventurers, who might advance to 2nd level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in the Tenth District of Ravnica and serves as an introductory adventure to the setting. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.",
				"Krenko is the boss of a notorious goblin mob, and he has made his fortune and built his reputation by mostly staying out of the guilds' way. He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District, but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, Krenko has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that Krenko killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.",
				"The remaining two brothers, Rikkig and Gardagig, attempted to kill Krenko in retaliation for the death of their kin. Before they could do the deed, Krenko was apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into Sawtooth Prison—near the legion's headquarters of Sunhome—to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But someone as well connected as Krenko has ways of shortening his own sentence.",
				"Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate. During the transfer, agents of a former associate of Krenko's created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.",
				"Krenko's escape is no small matter. The Chamber of the Guildpact gets involved, alarmed at the possibility of another goblin gang war that could threaten the tenuous peace between the guilds. During the adventure, the Shattergang Brothers catch wind of Krenko's freedom, and are desperate to make him pay.",

When the noble realized he was about to face embarrassment at the hands of a group of rowdy peasants, he took matters into his own hands and sent his armed guards to deliver resolution. Rather than face the consequences of beating a noble to near death, the characters all fled out the back door, robbing an unsuspecting ale carter of his cargo, wagon, and horses, then tearing off into the night.",

He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District, but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, Krenko has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that Krenko killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.",

But someone as well connected as Krenko has ways of shortening his own sentence.",

During the transfer, agents of a former associate of Krenko's created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.",
				"Krenko's escape is no small matter. The Chamber of the Guildpact gets involved, alarmed at the possibility of another goblin gang war that could threaten the tenuous peace between the guilds. During the adventure, the Shattergang Brothers catch wind of Krenko's freedom, and are desperate to make him pay.",

A few relaxed pints, lively conversation, and (if the stars aligned) a good old-fashioned bar brawl. When the fisticuffs came, they were with a visiting noble named Sir Dandeleone of Lavender, a middling minor knight from a family of no consequence. All things being equal, it should have been a classic dust-up, forgotten by the morning.",
				"But no. Things escalated. When the noble realized he was about to face embarrassment at the hands of a group of rowdy peasants, he took matters into his own hands and sent his armed guards to deliver resolution. Rather than face the consequences of beating a noble to near death, the characters all fled out the back door, robbing an unsuspecting ale carter of his cargo, wagon, and horses, then tearing off into the night.",
				"Remember how I said it escalated? Well, this is the point when things REALLY escalated. After a series of chaotic encounters, the crew wakes up in the middle of unfamiliar woods, next to a shattered wagon, with a figure hogtied hanging from a tree, and sitting next to a large, moaning wooden chest.",

				"Explore the mega-dungeon of Undermountain in this adventure for the world’s greatest roleplaying game.",
				"In the city of Waterdeep rests a tavern called the Yawning Portal, named after the gaping pit in its common room. At the bottom of this crumbling shaft is a labyrinthine dungeon shunned by all but the most daring adventurers. Known as Undermountain, this dungeon is the domain of the mad wizard Halaster Blackcloak. Long has the Mad Mage dwelt in these forlorn depths, seeding his lair with monsters, traps, and mysteries—to what end is a constant source of speculation and concern.",
				"This adventure picks up where Waterdeep: Dragon Heist leaves off, taking characters of 5th level or higher all the way to 20th level should they explore the entirety of Halaster’s home. Twenty-three levels of Undermountain are detailed herein, along with the subterranean refuge of Skullport. Treasures and secrets abound, but tread with care!",
